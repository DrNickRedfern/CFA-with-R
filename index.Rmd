**Welcome to *Computational Film Analysis with R*.** <br> <br> This online, interactive book is intended to be a first course in the application of computational methods to questions of form and style in the cinema using the R programming language. It aimed at those who have no previous experience of computational film analysis and no prior knowledge of statistics, data science or programming with R is required or assumed. Each chapter discusses the underlying methodological concepts of a range of approaches for analysing sound, colour, editing, shot types, and lexical texts of motion pictures in depth and demonstrates their implementation in R so that after reading this book researchers will be able to design and execute their own computational film analysis research projects. <br> <br> This book includes **interactive content** for the user to explore, including embedded video files, interactive plots, tables, and visualisations. Interactive content is identified by `r emo::ji("point_up")` or `r emo::ji("point_left")`.

## About the author {.unnumbered}

My name is Nick Redfern and I have been teaching and researching about film since 2001. I have taught film, media, and television studies at Manchester Metropolitan University, the University of Central Lancashire, and Leeds Trinity University. My work on computational film analysis has been published in the *Journal of Japanese and Korean Cinema*, *Statistica*, the *Journal of Data Science*, *Post Script*, *Digital Scholarship in the Humanities*, *Umanistica Digitale*, *Sound, Music, and the Moving Image*, *Humanities Bulletin*, *Acta Universitatis Sapientiae, Film and Media Studies*, and *Art and Perception*. You can read more about computational film analysis on my blog <https://computationalfilmanalysis.wordpress.com>.

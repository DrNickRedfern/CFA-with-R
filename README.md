</p>

This book is intended to be a first course in the application of computational methods to questions of form and style in the cinema using the R programming language. It aimed at those who have no previous experience of computational film analysis and no prior knowledge of statistics, data science or programming with R is required or assumed. Each chapter discusses the underlying methodological concepts of a range of approaches for analysing sound, colour, editing, shot types, and lexical texts of motion pictures in depth and demonstrates their implementation in R so that after reading this book researchers will be able to design and execute their own computational film analysis research projects.

This book includes interactive content for the user to explore, including embedded video files, interactive plots, tables, and visualisations. Interactive content is identified by :point_up: or :point_left:.

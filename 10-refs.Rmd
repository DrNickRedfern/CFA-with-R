/* All elements with class="csl-entry" ------------------------
Using the apa.csl file with bookdown does not add the correct spacing after each bibliography, making it difficult to read the text. Changing entry-spacing in the csl file does not seem to work and so it is necessary to adjust the bottom margin of cls-entry class by css.

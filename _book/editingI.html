</h1>
<p>The most common application of quantitative methods to the analysis of film style is to determine if the duration of shots in two (or more) motion pictures or two (or more) groups of films differ, and, if so, by how much they differ. Comparisons of shot lengths in motion pictures have been used to identify similarities and differences in the style of individual filmmakers, historical periods, genres, national cinemas, and the impact of new technologies on motion picture production.</p>
<p>In this chapter we will cover some methods for describing and comparing shot length data for motion pictures. The most important idea to be introduced in this chapter is that of a <em>distribution</em> because this concept underpins everything we do when we apply computational methods to motion picture shot length data. We will analyse the distribution of shot lengths in Alfred Hitchcock’s late-silent and early-sound films to see what they tell us about how the style of these films changed with the introduction of synchronised sound. We will apply a method based the quantiles of a shot length distribution to describe data sets numerically and we will learn a range of methods to visualise shot length data. Finally, we will ask three questions of the data for Hitchcock’s films to see how thinking distributionally about shot lengths can help us to improve the quality of our analyses.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Distributional thinking about film editing<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#distributional-thinking-about-film-editing"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>A <em>data set</em> comprises a collection of pieces of related information produced by measuring properties of a group of objects. A data set is characterised by <em>variation</em>, which, in simple terms, is the quality of a measured property of an object to vary <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-makar2005vtam" role="doc-biblioref">Makar &amp; Confrey, 2005</a>)</span>. Chris Wild argues that the need for statistics flows from variation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the statistical response to variation is to investigate, disentangle, and model patterns of variation in order to learn from them. Virtually all of the ways statisticians do this involve looking at the data through a lens which is distribution <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-wild2006tcod" role="doc-biblioref">Wild, 2006</a>: 21)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A <em>distribution</em> is a representation of the variation of a data set that allows us to organise and examine data efficiently to gain an overall understanding of how the data varies. Aisling Leavy argues that an understanding of distribution requires ‘an awareness of the propensity of a variable to vary and comprehension of how that variability contributes to the notion of the distribution as an aggregate rather than a collection of individual data points’ <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-leavy2006udct" role="doc-biblioref">Leavy, 2006</a>: 90)</span>. <em>Distributional thinking</em> is quantitative reasoning about variation, distribution, and the relationship between them <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-bakker2004ltra" role="doc-biblioref">Bakker &amp; Gravemeijer, 2004</a>; <a href="references.html#ref-prodromou2007tcod" role="doc-biblioref">Prodromou, 2007</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>When we talk about the distribution of a data set, we need to describe a range of features, including the overall shape of the distribution and any deviations from that overall shape. To describe a distribution, we need to ask the following questions about its various features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>centre</em>: where is the mass of the data located? Where is the centre of the data located? What is the typical value of a data set?</li>
<li>
<em>spread</em>: how much variability is there in the data set?</li>
<li>
<em>symmetry</em> (skewness): is the distribution symmetrical? Is the bulk of the data to the left of the distribution with a long right tail (positively skewed)? Or is the bulk of the data to the right of the distribution with a long left tail (negatively skewed)?</li>
<li>
<em>modality</em>: how many peaks does the distribution have?</li>
<li>
<em>peakedness</em>: is the shape of the peak(s) flat and broad or tall and pointed?</li>
<li>
<em>tailedness</em> (kurtosis): how much of the data is in the tails of the distribution relative to the centre?</li>
<li>
<em>outliers</em>: are there any deviations from the overall pattern of the data? Are there observations that are noticeably distinct from the bulk of the data?</li>
</ul>
<p>In attending to these features we attempt to account for the variation in a data set that deals with its complexity that may arise in a range of different situations.</p>
<p>When talking about the editing of motion pictures a data set comprises the duration of each shot in the film – the variable of interest – and a <em>shot length distribution</em> is the way in which we think and talk about that data and how we compare different data sets for different films. However, if we look at the common applications of statistics to questions of film editing, we see that concepts of ‘variation’ or ‘distribution’ are seldom present. Distributional thinking of the sort Wild and Leavy describe as fundamental to statistical reasoning about data is rarely a part of the statistical analysis of film style.</p>
<p>At present, most descriptions in the literature on film style do not address the features of shot length distributions, relying on comparisons of average shot lengths (ASLs) alone. In many cases, it is not possible to get any other information about the style of a film or a group of films because the concept of a distribution does not appear to be well-understood in Film Studies. Most researchers applying statistical methods to the analysis of shot lengths in fact collect no data and never produce a shot length distribution, relying instead on a single number produced by dividing the running time of a film by the number of shots in that film. Consequently, they are unable to provide any information about the shot length data for a film beyond the ASL. Even when researchers do collect the full data set on shot durations for a film they only report the ASL and ignore other features of shot length distributions that are potentially interesting, such as the variability of the data or the shape of the shot length distribution. Only a small proportion of the literature addresses features of shot length distributions beyond the ASL (see, for example, <span class="citation">Baxter et al. (<a href="references.html#ref-baxter2017ecsi" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>; <span class="citation">Fujita (<a href="references.html#ref-fujita1989sldi" role="doc-biblioref">1989</a>)</span>; <span class="citation">Kohara &amp; Niimi (<a href="references.html#ref-kohara2013tsls" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>; and <span class="citation">Redfern (<a href="references.html#ref-redfern2020mslo" role="doc-biblioref">2020a</a>)</span>). The result is that a lack of distributional thinking characterises most applications of quantitative methods to the analysis of film style.</p>

<p>We need to <a href="https://tavareshugo.github.io/r-intro-tidyverse-gapminder/09-reshaping/index.html">re-arrange</a> the data so it is in a <em>long</em> format with one column for each variable – <code>film</code> and <code>SL</code> (Table <a href="editingI.html#tab:editingI-data-table-pivoteddata">6.3</a>). Reshaping the data frame to a long format makes it easier to apply data wrangling operations to the data frame. As we saw in Chapter <a href="tools.html#tools">3</a>, the data frame also contains a number of <code>NA</code> values because each film has a different number of shots that need to be removed.</p>

<p>We will set the film titles as a factor so that they will display in the order we specify (i.e., the order of release) rather than the alphabetical order to which <code><a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.html">ggplot2::ggplot()</a></code> defaults. This will make it easier to see how shot length distributions in Hitchcock’s film changed over time.</p>

<p>Finally, we will add a column called <code>type</code> to the <code>df_hitchcock</code> data frame that identifies whether a film in the data set is a silent film or a sound film. The <code>%in%</code> <a href="https://www.programmingr.com/tutorial/in-operator/">operator</a> is used to identify if an element is a member of a vector or data frame. Combined with the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/ifelse.html">ifelse()</a></code> function we use it here to check if any of titles of the four silent films occur in the <code>df_hitchcock</code> data frame, and if they do we write the value <code>Silent</code> to the <code>type</code> column when they occur and writes the value <code>Sound</code> to the <code>type</code> column when they do not occur. This gives us the data frame with the format illustrated in Table <a href="editingI.html#tab:editingI-data-table-type">6.4</a> to work with.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Numerical summaries of shot length data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#numerical-summaries-of-shot-length-data"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Descriptive statistics are <em>indices</em> of a distribution <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-leavy2006udct" role="doc-biblioref">Leavy, 2006</a>)</span>, summarizing data sets using a small number of features that make large data sets manageable.</p>
<p>A conceptually simple method of describing and comparing shot length distributions is to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile">quantiles</a> of the distributions. A <em>quantile</em> (<span class="math inline">\(Q_{p}\)</span>) is a cut point dividing a data set arranged in order from the smallest value to largest so that a specified proportion <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> of the data set lies below that point <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-altman1994snqq" role="doc-biblioref">D. G. Altman &amp; Bland, 1994</a>)</span>. The <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-th quantile of a data set is found using the quantile function</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Q_{p} = \{x:Pr(X \leq x) = p\}
\]</span></p>
<p>Commonly used quantiles are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median">median</a> (<span class="math inline">\(Q_{0.5}\)</span>) of a data set, dividing the range into two equal parts, or the lower (<span class="math inline">\(Q_{0.25}\)</span>) and upper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile">quartiles</a> (<span class="math inline">\(Q_{0.75}\)</span>) that cut off the lower and upper 25% of a data set, respectively; but quantiles for any value of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> can be used. There is one less quantile than the numbers of groups created by dividing a data set into subsets of equal size: to divide a data set into 20 equal parts we need 19 quantiles.</p>
<p>The features of a shot length distribution listed above can be described in terms of its quantiles. The median shot length is a measure of location, while the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range">interquartile range</a>, the difference between the upper and lower quartiles: <span class="math inline">\(IQR = Q_{0.75} – Q_{0.25}\)</span>, describes the spread of a distribution.</p>
<p>The symmetry of a distribution is described by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness">skewness</a> coefficient,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
S = \frac{Q_{0.25} + Q_{0.75}-2Q_{0.5}}{Q_{0.75}-Q_{0.25}}
\]</span></p>
<p>which takes on values between -1 and 1. Values of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> greater than 0 indicate positive skewness. Positive skewness indicates that the right, upper tail of a distribution is longer than the lower, left tail and is typical for motion picture shot length distributions.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis">kurtosis</a> of a distribution can also be described in terms of quantiles:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
T = \frac{(Q_{0.875}-Q_{0.625}) + (Q_{0.375}-Q_{0.125})}{Q_{0.75} - Q_{0.25}}
\]</span></p>
<p>Kurtosis measures the combined weight of the mass of data in the tails of a distribution relative to its centre, with higher values of kurtosis indicating there are a lot of data points in the tails <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-westfall2014kapn" role="doc-biblioref">Westfall, 2014</a>)</span>. For <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, the two terms in the numerator measure the combined weight of the shoulders of a distribution while the denominator is the <span class="math inline">\(IQR\)</span>, which describes the middle of the distribution. The terms in the numerator will be large if relatively more data is in the shoulders than in the centre of a distribution resulting in higher values of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-moors1988aqaf" role="doc-biblioref">Moors, 1988</a>)</span>. Kurtosis is, then, a measure of the presence of outliers in the data.</p>
<p>Taken together, these four statistics – median, interquartile range, quantile skewness, and quantile kurtosis – provide an informative, intuitive, and robust numerical summary of the distribution of shot lengths in a motion picture. These numerical descriptions do not require any assumptions to be made about possible models for a shot length distribution.</p>
<p>We can create a simple function that calculates the quantile-based summary of the shot length data of a film. There are multiple methods for calculating the quantiles of a data set. Here we will use the <a href="https://garstats.wordpress.com/2016/06/09/the-harrell-davis-quantile-estimator/">Harrell-Davis quantile estimator</a> produced using the <code>hdquantile()</code> function in the Hmisc package.</p>

<span id="tab:editingI-numerical-table-SLsummary">Table 6.5: </span>Descriptive statistics of the shot lengths of Alfred Hitchcock’s late-silent and early-sound films. ☝

</table></div>
<p>From the quantile-based descriptive statistics in Table <a href="editingI.html#tab:editingI-numerical-table-SLsummary">6.5</a>, we see that the four silent films (<em>The Ring</em>, <em>The Farmer’s Wife</em>, <em>Champagne</em>, and <em>The Manxman</em>) have shot length distributions that are relatively consistent, with similar median shot lengths and interquartile ranges. With the shift to sound filmmaking in 1929, Hitchcock’s early sound films (<em>Blackmail</em>, <em>Murder!</em>, <em>The Skin Game</em>) show an obvious change in editing style with increases in the median as shots tended to become longer in duration and a more varied use shot lengths seen in the change in the interquartile range. There is also a change in the shape of shot length distribution as indicated by the increase in quantile skewness and quantile kurtosis. The difference between these early sound films and the silent movies that preceded them is an increase in the spread of shot lengths above the median as dialogue shots required longer takes, accompanied by a smaller shift towards more rapid editing as the spread of shots below the median shot length became slightly lower. For the later sound films we see a shift to an editing style characterised by shorter takes similar to the silent films and but with shot length distributions that are more skewed and kurtose like his first sound films. <em>Rich and Strange</em> has a number of rapidly edited montage sequences, such as the Paris sequence or the leisure activities aboard of the cruise ship, and a series of drawn-out conversational sequences that are cut more slowly; while <em>Number Seventeen</em> is largely comprised of a rapidly cut extended chase sequence in between two slower cut sequences at the house and the harbour, and which again maintains a distinction between dialogue heavy scenes and action.</p>

</h2>
<p>Numerical summaries are useful descriptions of shot length distributions but they are limited in the amount of information they contain and require skill to be interpreted meaningfully.</p>
<p>Visualising the distribution of shot lengths in a film makes it easier to see the structure of the data, especially when working with large and/or multiple data sets. I often find that the information contained in numerical summaries begins to take on a concrete meaning only after visualising the data. Effective visual summaries allow us to discover patterns at different scales of analysis from gaining an overall picture of a data set at the macro-level to focusing on particular details at the micro-level. They also allow us to communicate the results of our analysis simply and effectively.</p>
<p>The use of graphical methods should be common practice in the statistical analysis of film style but it remains the case that many film scholars rely solely on numerical summaries of shot length data and do not visualise their data at all (if they actually have any data to visualise). In this section I describe four methods of visualising shot length distributions using the kernel density, the quantile profile, the empirical cumulative distribution function, and the adjusted boxplot.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">6.4.1</span> Kernel densities<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#kernel-densities"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation">kernel density</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonparametric_statistics">non-parametric</a> estimate of the distribution of values in a data set. To calculate the kernel density, we fit a kernel function over each data point and sum the values of the kernel at each point on the x-axis.</p>
<p>The kernel density estimator is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{nh} \sum_{i=1}^{n}K\bigg(\frac{x-x_{i}}{h}\bigg)
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of shots in a film, <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is a smoothing parameter called the <em>bandwidth</em>, and <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> is the <em>kernel function</em>. Figure <a href="editingI.html#fig:editingI-kde-plot-demo">6.1</a> shows a detail from the kernel density of <em>The Skin Game</em>. Beneath the density, a black diamond indicates the length of a shot (<span class="math inline">\(x_{i}\)</span>). The Gaussian kernels fitted over each data point are shown in green and the density at any point on the x-axis is equal to the sum of the kernel functions at that point. The closer the data points are to one another, the more the fitted kernels overlap and the greater the sum of the kernels and, therefore, the greater the density at that point.</p>

</div>
<p>The choice of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(statistics)#Kernel_functions_in_common_use">kernel function</a> is relatively unimportant and here we will simply use the Gaussian kernel that is the default. The choice of bandwidth determines the shape of the density estimate and is much more important. To illustrate this, move the slider in Figure <a href="editingI.html#fig:editingI-kde-plot-bw">6.2</a> to adjust the bandwidth of the kernel density estimate of the distribution of shot lengths in <em>The Skin Game</em>. If the bandwidth is too narrow the density estimate will be over-fitted and noisy with lots of localised spikes obscuring the structure in the data. Equally, if the bandwidth is too wide the density estimate will be over-smoothed and will again obscure the structure of the data.</p>

Figure 6.2: The kernel density of <em>The Skin Game</em> (1931) estimated with a range of bandwidth values. ☝️
</p>
</div>
<p>Setting the bandwidth to between 1 and 3 in Figure <a href="editingI.html#fig:editingI-kde-plot-bw">6.2</a> is a reasonable compromise that lets us see the structure of the data without being under- or over-smoothed, enabling us to identify the key features of the distribution’s shape. The distribution has a single tall, sharp peak and is clearly positively skewed, with most shots having duration less than 10 seconds but a very long right, upper tail that includes some outliers with very long duration (the longest shot in the film is 281 seconds) to give a large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_(statistics)">range</a> of values.</p>
<p>Using the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/introduction.html">ggridges</a> package, we can efficiently plot the kernel density of each film in the early Hitchcock data set on a single plot (Figure <a href="editingI.html#fig:editingI-kde-plot-ggridges">6.3</a>), with reference lines for the median shot length and the lower- and upper-quartiles added by setting <code>quantile_lines = TRUE</code>. Due to the skewed nature of shot length distributions it is easier to see the data by plotting shot length on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_scale">logarithmic scale</a>.</p>

Figure 6.3: Shot length distributions of films directed by Alfred Hitchcock, 1927-1932. The quantile lines in each density plot show the lower quartile, median, and upper quartile of each distribution.
</p>
</div>
<p>The summary statistics give us an overall impression of the difference in shot length distributions between Hitchcock’s late silent and early sound films, but we do not yet know anything about the nature of that difference. Visualising the distributions by plotting their kernel densities in Figure <a href="editingI.html#fig:editingI-kde-plot-ggridges">6.3</a> gives concrete meaning to the median shot length and interquartile range as indicated by the quantile lines each plot, making it clear how the descriptive statistics relate to data and illustrating how shot lengths in <em>Blackmail</em>, <em>Murder!</em>, and <em>The Skin Game</em> are more widely dispersed than those of the other films and how shot lengths initially increase with the shift to synchronised sound before shortening in duration. The shape of the distribution of shot lengths for <em>Blackmail</em> in Figure <a href="editingI.html#fig:editingI-kde-plot-ggridges">6.3</a> resembles the distributions of the silent film in the quartiles of the lower tail and the quartiles of the upper tail of the sound films that followed its release. This pattern emerges due to the unique production circumstances of <em>Blackmail</em>, which was released in both silent and sound versions described by Charles Barr as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>works of continuously inventive bricolage. Juxtaposing them scene by scene, one registers a set of permutations: points at which variously, (a) both versions use ‘silent’ visuals; (b) both versions use ‘sound’ visuals; (c) silent and sound visuals are mixed within a scene; (d) the two films use entirely different visuals <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-barr1983bsas" role="doc-biblioref">Barr, 1983</a>: 123)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The change in distributional shape indicated by the quantile skewness and kurtosis values is evident, with the similarity of shape of the silent films clear to see and the shift in the mass of the data for the sound films in the upper tail of the distribution relative to the centre of the distribution.</p>

<p>Having described the distribution of shot lengths numerically using quantiles, we can visualise the distribution by plotting a quantile profile <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-johnson2015opc" role="doc-biblioref">Johnson et al., 2015</a>)</span> for each film in a data set. The quantile profile does not show information about the shape of a distribution in an accessible way, but it does make it easier to directly compare different parts of the shot length distributions of a set of films.</p>
<p>First, we need to calculate the quantiles for each film from <span class="math inline">\(Q_{0.05}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(Q_{0.95}\)</span> at intervals of 0.05. The results are displayed in Table <a href="editingI.html#tab:editingI-quantiles-table-quantiles">6.6</a>.</p>

Figure 6.4: The quantile profiles for Alfred Hitchcock’s late-silent and early-sound films. ☝️
</p>
</div>
<p>The quantile profiles clearly show that the silent films are much more consistent in the distribution of their shot lengths than the sound films, which exhibit much greater variation in shot length at different quantiles. We can also see evidence of a hybrid editing style: with the exception of one of the sound films (<em>Blackmail</em>), Hitchcock’s editing style after the introduction of sound meant that takes of shorter duration were slightly shorter than those of his silent films and, at the same time, longer takes in Hitchcock films increased in duration.</p>

Interactive plots in R with plotly
</h3>
<p>
<a href="https://plotly.com/r/">plotly</a> is an R package for
creating interactive plots using the plotly.js <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>
library.
</p>
<p>
plotly has its own syntax for producing interactive plots in R, but
the <code>ggplotly()</code> function provides easy integration with the
ggplot2 package. As the example of quantile plot in this chapter
illustrates, we can create a <code>ggplot()</code> object
<code>quantile_plot</code> and then makes this plot interactive by
passing it to <code>ggplotly()</code>:
<code>ggplotly(quantile_plot)</code>.
</p>
<p>
Users can interact with plotly plots in different ways.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Moving a mouse pointer over a plot generated by plotly will bring up
the modebar in the top right of the plot window. Users may select a
range of actions from the modebar, including downloading the plot as a
<code>.png</code> file; zooming, panning, or selecting sections of the
plot to focus on specific elements; and choose whether to display
information about the nearest data point on hover or if comparative data
should be shown when moving the mouse over a data set.
</li>
<li>
Hovering a mouse over a data point or a line will show a tool tip
containing information about the data at that point. Information can be
added as a text aesthetic in the <code>ggplot()</code> object and then
called by passing that aesthetic to <code>ggplotly()</code> using
<code>tooltip = “text”</code>. Tooltips can also be specified outside
the <code>ggplot()</code> object.
</li>
<li>
Users can remove data from a plot by single-clicking on an element
in the legend. Double-clicking on an element in the legend isolates that
data removing all other traces from the plot. Traces can then be added
back to the plot by single-clicking on elements in the legend.
</li>
<li>
Plots can be animated to show change over time, allowing users to
play the animation from start to finish or to select a frame by using a
slider representing.
</li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_distribution_function">empirical cumulative distribution function</a> (ECDF) is a complete description of a data set that is simple to understand. The ECDF is the proportion of a data set less than or equal to a given value:</p>

<p>The ECDF is the inverse of the quantile function described above and swapping the axes in the plot of the quantile profile in Figure <a href="editingI.html#fig:editingI-quantiles-plot-quantiles">6.4</a> gives a plot of the ECDF.</p>
<p>It is easy to calculate the ECDF: simply arrange the shot length values in order from shortest to longest, count the number of shots in a film (<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>) that are less than or equal to some specified value (<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>), and divide that number by the total number of shots in a film (<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>). To illustrate this process we will calculate the ECDF of <em>Blackmail</em> (Table <a href="editingI.html#tab:editingI-ecdf-table-blackmail">6.7</a>) and plot the function.</p>

<p>The ECDF is easy to calculate requiring no complicated mathematics – simply count, divide, and add. The plot is easy to produce and provides a lot of information about a data set for every little effort and, as we shall see below, is also a simple way of comparing multiple data sets.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">6.4.4</span> Adjusted boxplot<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#adjusted-boxplot"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot">boxplot</a> is an excellent way of visualising a shot length data, conveying information about the location, spread, and shape of a distribution, as well as identifying any outlying data points. Boxplots are also an efficient method for comparing multiple distributions.</p>
<p>The boxplot provides a graphical representation of the numerical summary of a distribution. The interquartile range of a distribution is represented as a box, with the median indicated by a line through that box. The whiskers extending from the box mark the limits beyond which data points are considered to be outliers.</p>
<p>Due to the positively-skewed nature of the distribution of shot lengths in motion pictures it is necessary to use an <a href="https://ai.plainenglish.io/use-adjusted-boxplot-for-skewed-distribution-d1bc0ec25f6d">adjusted version</a> of the boxplot to avoid incorrectly identifying data points as outliers. The adjustment described by <span class="citation">Hubert &amp; Vandervieren (<a href="references.html#ref-hubert2008aabf" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span> is based on the quantile skewness measure described above. An implementation of the adjusted box plot is available in the robustbase package, which includes functions for both directly plotting the adjusted boxplot using <code>adjbox()</code> and for computing the statistics for producing adjusted boxplots with <code>adjboxStats()</code> that we can then plot using ggplot2.</p>
<p>We can create a function <code>adjboxplot()</code> that will calculate the required statistics for drawing an adjusted box plot using <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/robustbase/man/adjboxStats.html">robustbase::adjboxStats()</a></code> and then plot the result. The input for the function is a data frame in long format with the variables <code>film</code> and <code>SL</code>.</p>

<p>From Figure <a href="editingI.html#fig:editingI-adjbox-code-apply">6.7</a> we see that the shot length distributions of Hitchcock’s early sound films exhibit a variety of changes. After <em>Blackmail</em>, we see there is little variation in the centre of the distributions or in the range of the data but there is an change in the <span class="math inline">\(IQR\)</span>, with a decrease in the lower quartile and an increase in the upper quartile. This indicates that after the hybrid style of <em>Blackmail</em>, which combined shots produced the silent and sound versions, the editing in Hitchcock’s early sound films, <em>Murder!</em> and <em>The Skin Game</em>, shorter takes became slightly shorter while shots in the third quartile became longer to accommodate dialogue shots. The shift to a more rapid editing style in <em>Rich and Strange</em> and <em>Number Seventeen</em> is evident in the shift of the distribution to short shot duration, a narrower <span class="math inline">\(IQR\)</span>, and the smaller range of shot lengths. We can also see that there are more outlying data points in the later sound films, visualising the information represented by the quantile kurtosis, <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, in much more intuitive way.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="editingI.html#fig:editingI-adjbox-code-apply">6.7</a> contains much of the information available in Table <a href="editingI.html#tab:editingI-numerical-table-SLsummary">6.5</a>, but presenting that information visually makes the similarities and differences between the distributions easier to perceive than trying to read a large set of numbers in a tabular format.</p>

</h2>
<p>Now that we know how to describe and visualise the distribution of shot lengths in a film, we can apply these methods to ask questions about the evolution of style in Hitchcock’s films with the transition from silent to sound filmmaking.</p>
<div id="question-1" class="section level3" number="6.5.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">6.5.1</span> Question 1<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#question-1"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>One approach to comparing shot duration in motion pictures is to ask:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How does the typical shot length in film <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> compare to the typical shot length in film <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Answers to this question are typically presented as a comparison of the films’ respective cutting rates as measured by their average shot lengths, which describes the mean (<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>) waiting time between cuts (Salt, 1974, 1992). Conventionally, the size of the difference between the average shot lengths of two films (<span class="math inline">\(\mu_{Y} - \mu_{X}\)</span>) is interpreted as the difference in style between films <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. This is the dominant approach used in statistical analyses of film style and film scholars such as <span class="citation">Bordwell (<a href="references.html#ref-bordwell2002icvs" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Buckland (<a href="references.html#ref-buckland2006dbss" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">O’Brien (<a href="references.html#ref-obrien2009sltd" role="doc-biblioref">2009</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Roggen (<a href="references.html#ref-roggen2019cras" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>, and <span class="citation">Salt (<a href="references.html#ref-salt1992fsat" role="doc-biblioref">1992</a>)</span>, amongst many others, all rely on the ASL as a means of describing differences in editing style (in many cases, exclusively so).</p>
<p>A key problem with this approach is that differences in average shot length do <em>not</em> reflect differences in style. For example, Barry Salt challenges Andrew Sarris’s claim that Lewis Milestone’s <em>The Front Page</em> (1931) is edited more quickly than <em>His Girl Friday</em> (1940), arguing that this is not in fact the case because both films have the same ASL. However, he also points out they are not stylistically similar: “The average shot length of both movies is the same; however, the Milestone film achieves this by having a larger number of very short shots and a larger number of very long shots” <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-salt1974ssao" role="doc-biblioref">Salt, 1974</a>: 18)</span>.</p>
<p>If we compare the means for <em>The Manxman</em> and <em>Rich and Strange</em> we see that the latter has a higher ASL, which, according to the conventional interpretation of ASLs, means that the sound film is edited more slowly. However, if we plot the distributions of shot lengths for these films (Figure <a href="editingI.html#fig:editingI-question1-plot-kde">6.8</a>) we see that <em>Rich and Strange</em> has more shorter takes and more longer takes than <em>The Manxman</em> – a feature not captured by the ASLs.</p>

Reasons not to use the average shot length part I
</h3>
<p>
The most common (and typically <em>only</em>) statistic used to
describe the editing of a film is the <em>average shot length</em>
(ASL).
</p>
<p>
If descriptive statistics are indices of a distribution, what does
the ASL tell us about the distribution of shot lengths in a motion
picture?
</p>
<p>
Motion picture shot length distributions are positively skewed.
Because the mean of a positively skewed distribution is pulled in the
direction of the right tail by the presence of outlying data points, the
ASL does <em>not</em> describe the centre of a shot length distribution.
Furthermore, the ASL contains no information about the spread, symmetry,
modality, tailedness, or peakedness of the data, or about the presence
of outliers in a shot length distribution.
</p>
<p>
<span class="citation"><span class="citation">Salt (<a href="references.html#ref-salt1992fsat" role="doc-biblioref">1992</a>: 146)</span></span> describes the
average shot length as a ‘rather obvious concept,’ but the meaning of
the ASL is elusive. If it does not describe a feature of a shot length
distribution, what does the mean mean?
</p>
<p>
<strong>Inferences about ASLs are just that – inferences about ASLs –
and they tell us nothing the distribution of shot lengths in motion

<span class="header-section-number">6.5.2</span> Question 2<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#question-2"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>An alternative way to address the problem of comparing the shot lengths in two films is to systematically compare all the shot lengths in two films and to ask:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do the shots in film <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> tend to be longer than shots in film <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In statistical terms, to answer this question we test if the two distributions are <em>stochastically equal</em> by testing if the probability of a shot from film <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> being greater than a shot from film <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is equal to the probability of a shot from <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> being greater than one from <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</p>
<p>To calculate the probability that a shot in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> has greater duration than a shot in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> <span class="math inline">\((P(Y&gt;X))\)</span>, we count the number of times the number of times a shot in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> has duration greater than that of a shot in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and divide by the product of the number of shots (<span class="math inline">\(N_{X}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N_{Y}\)</span>) in each film:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
P(Y &gt; X) = \frac{\#Y_{j}&gt;X_{i}}{N_{X}N_{Y}}
\]</span></p>
<p>To find the probability that the length of a shot in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is shorter than the length of a shot in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> <span class="math inline">\((P(Y&lt;X))\)</span> we perform the same procedure based on the number of times a shot in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is shorter than a shot in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(P(Y&gt;X) = P(Y&lt;X)\)</span>, then there is no tendency for shots in one film to have shots of duration greater/less than shots in the other. If <span class="math inline">\(P(Y&gt;X)\)</span> is greater than <span class="math inline">\(P(Y&lt;X)\)</span>, the shots in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> tend to have longer duration than those in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(P(Y&gt;X)\)</span> is less than <span class="math inline">\(P(Y&lt;X)\)</span>, the shots in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> tend to have shorter duration than those in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p>The stochastic equality of the distributions can be assessed using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_dominance">dominance statistics</a> <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(HL\Delta\)</span> <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-redfern2014ctsl" role="doc-biblioref">Redfern, 2014a</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Cliff’s <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> statistic <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-cliff1993dsoa" role="doc-biblioref">Cliff, 1993</a>, <a href="references.html#ref-cliff1996omfb" role="doc-biblioref">1996</a>)</span> is a simple, non-parametric method of testing the stochastic equality of two distributions:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
d = P(Y &gt; X) - P(Y &lt; X)
\]</span></p>
<p>The value of <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> ranges from -1, when every shot in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> has shorter duration than every shot in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, to 1, when every shot in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> has longer duration than every shot in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Stochastic equality <span class="math inline">\((P(Y&gt;X) = P(Y&lt;X))\)</span> occurs when <span class="math inline">\(d = 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can calculate <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> quickly using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann%E2%80%93Whitney_U_test">Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test</a> (WMW) test, which is a nonparametric statistical test to determine if there is a difference between two datasets by testing if one sample is stochastically superior to the other. The <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> statistic of stochastic superiority is equal to <span class="math inline">\(P(Y &gt; X) + 0.5P(Y = X)\)</span>, and can be calculated as <span class="math inline">\(A = U/N_{Y}N_{X}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> is the test statistic of the WMW test <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-delaney2002csrt" role="doc-biblioref">Delaney &amp; Vargha, 2002</a>)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is then a linear transformation of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(d = 2A – 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Cliff’s <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> statistic has numerous advantages over the standard practice of comparing ASLs to determine differences between shot length distributions: it does not require any assumptions about the data; it is robust against outliers and unequal variances; it is invariant under monotonic transformation; and it provides a more direct answer to the sort of questions researchers often wish to ask of data. As Cliff points out,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if one’s primary interest is in a quantification of the statement “<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>s tend to be higher than <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>s,” then [<span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>] provides an unambiguous description of the extent to which this is so <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-cliff1996omfb" role="doc-biblioref">Cliff, 1996</a>: 125)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A limitation of Cliff’s <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is that while it helps us to understand if the shots in one film tend to be shorter/longer than the shots in another it does not tell us how <em>much</em> shorter or longer they tend to be. To answer this question we need another statistic.</p>
<p>The <em>Hodges-Lehman difference</em> is the median of the pairwise differences between every shot in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and every shot in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> <span class="citation">(<a href="references.html#ref-hodges1963eolb" role="doc-biblioref">Hodges &amp; Lehmann, 1963</a>)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
HL \Delta = median\{Y_{j} - X_{i}\}
\]</span></p>
<p>In other words, we subtract the length of every shot in film <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> from every shot in film <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> and then find the median of the <span class="math inline">\(N_{X} × N_{Y}\)</span> differences.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(HL\Delta &gt; 0\)</span>, then the shots in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> tend to be of greater duration than those in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, and if <span class="math inline">\(HL\Delta &lt; 0\)</span> is less than zero, the shots in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> tend to be of shorter duration than those in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. When <span class="math inline">\(HL\Delta = 0\)</span> there is no tendency for shots in one film to be longer than those in the other.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(HL\Delta\)</span> is an analogue to <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>, with the advantage that it expresses differences in style on the same measurement scale as the data under analysis (i.e., shot lengths in seconds). However, <span class="math inline">\(HL\Delta\)</span> does not tell us if a difference of, say 2 seconds, is a small or a large difference – which is what <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> measures. These statistics should therefore be used in conjunction to provide complimentary pieces of information when comparing shot length distributions.</p>
<p>Let’s compare the shot length distributions of <em>The Ring</em> and <em>Number Seventeen</em>. First, let’s get the data for these two films from the <code>df_hitchcock</code> data frame and split them into separate objects:</p>

<p>From the fact that <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(HL\Delta\)</span> are negative, we conclude that shots in <em>Number Seventeen</em> tend to be of shorter duration than those in <em>The Ring</em> and that the median pairwise difference is almost a second.</p>
<p>A limitation of Cliff’s <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(HL\Delta\)</span> is that while they tell us if the shots in film <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> tend to be longer than shots in film <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and the size of that difference, they contain no information about the nature of that difference. This problem may be addressed by visualising the shot length distributions using the empirical cumulative distribution function described above. To see where the difference in shot length distributions lie, we can plot each film’s ECDF.</p>

</div>
<p>From Figure <a href="editingI.html#fig:editing-question2-plot-ecdf">6.9</a> we see that for the majority of their respective distributions the ECDF of <em>The Ring</em> lies to the right of the corresponding function for <em>Number Seventeen</em> because shot lengths in the former tend to be longer than those in the latter. At the same time we can see that longer shots in the latter film tend to be longer than those in the former.</p>
<p>Extending this approach to compare groups of films is simple by calculating the dominance statistics for all the silent and sound films. We can embed a <code>for</code> loop within a <code>for</code> loop for the complete set of pairwise results and use <a href="https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/nest.html"><code>tidyr::nest()</code></a> to put the data for each from film into its own data frame and collect all those data frames into a single object (Table <a href="editingI.html#tab:editingI-question2-table-dominance">6.9</a>).</p>

</div>
<p>From the change in the colours alone in Figure <a href="editingI.html#fig:editingI-question2-plot-heatmap">6.10</a> we can see a shift in Hitchcock’s editing from <em>Blackmail</em> to <em>Number Seventeen</em> when compared to the silent films, with shots length in the first sound films tending to be longer in duration than the silent films, while <em>Rich and Strange</em> and <em>Number Seventeen</em> tend to have shots of shorter duration. For example, we see that shots in <em>Rich and Strange</em> tend to be shorter in duration than those of <em>The Manxman</em>, which is the <em>opposite</em> of what the ASLs of these films tell us.</p>
<div class="rmdtip">
<h3 style="margin-top: -5px; font-weight: bold;">
Reasons not to use the average shot length part II
</h3>
<p>
We commit an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_fallacy">ecological
fallacy</a> when we ascribe to an individual the characteristics of the
group to which they belong. There are different versions of the
ecological fallacy but the one we are concerned with here is <em>an
error in statistical inference arising from the assumption that if you
select an individual from a group with a higher mean, that individual
will have a higher value</em>.
</p>
<p>
This fallacy is evident in the use of the average shot length as a
statistic of film style.
</p>
<p>
The ASLs for <em>The Ring</em> and <em>Number Seventeen</em> are
5.01s and 5.66s, respectively. According to the conventional
interpretation, this means that shot lengths in <em>Number
Seventeen</em> have longer duration than those in <em>The Ring</em>.
</p>
<p>
However, having applied the dominance statistics approach to
comparing the shot length distributions of these films we see that shots
in <em>Number Seventeen</em> tend to be shorter than those in <em>The
Ring</em> – exactly the <em>opposite</em> of what the ASLs apparently
tell us.
</p>
<p>
Using the difference in the ASLs of these films as a means of
comparing the duration of their shots would have lead us to make commit
an ecological fallacy when making inferences about the differences in
shot length distributions of these films by assuming that because
<em>Number Seventeen</em> has the greater ASL the shots in this film
would have greater duration than those in <em>The Ring</em>.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, we see the difference in ASLs (5.66 - 5.01 = 0.65
seconds) under estimates the pairwise difference in shot lengths of 0.84
seconds given by the Hodges-Lehmann difference.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Comparing films based on their respective ASLs cannot be
relied upon to accurately reflect differences in style between films and
we will often find ourselves committing an ecological fallacy when we
rely upon the ASL. Nor can the difference between two ASLs be
interpreted as a meaningful estimate of the size of the difference
between films.</strong>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">6.5.3</span> Question 3<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#question-3"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The ASL tells us nothing about the distribution of shot lengths in a film and being able to interpret the difference in the ASLs of <em>The Front Page</em> and <em>His Girl Friday</em>, for example, it is necessary to have additional information about their respective shot length distributions.</p>
<p>Cliff’s <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(HL\Delta\)</span> describe differences in style at a global level, but in order to fully understand what these statistics are telling us it is necessary to visualise the empirical cumulative distribution functions of the films we analyse.</p>
<p>In both of the above cases it is necessary to refer to the distribution of shot lengths to contextualise the meaning of the summary measures used. It therefore makes sense to begin any comparison of motion picture shot length by thinking distributionally about differences in film style. We can therefore ask:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do shot lengths in specific parts of their respective distributions compare between films?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To answer this question we can compare the quantiles across two groups of films, subtracting the value of the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-th quantile of each silent film from the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-th quantile of each sound film and plot the distribution of the differences.</p>
<p>We can create a simple function <code>qdiff()</code> to calculate the pairwise quantile differences between the silent and sound films in the early Hitchcock data set. This function takes two matrices of quantiles as inputs(<code>x</code> and <code>y</code>), assuming the matrices have equal shapes and that the step in the quantiles are equal. The argument <code>p</code> is the step increase for the quantiles, which in this case is 0.05.</p>

<p>To prepare the data, we need to split the data frame <code>df_hitchcock_quantiles</code> we produced earlier that contains the quantiles for each film according to the type of film – silent or sound – and to pivot the data frame to a wide format. Before applying the <code>qdiff()</code> function to the data for silent and sound films we first drop the columns containing <code>film</code> and <code>type</code> because these will not be used in the calculations and convert the data format to a matrix, the input type expected by the function.</p>

Figure 6.11: Difference distributions for pairwise differences between quantiles of shot length distributions of films directed by Alfred Hitchcock, 1927-1932. Positive differences indicate that quantiles the sound films in the sample are higher than those of the silent films.
</p>
</div>
<p>From Figure <a href="editingI.html#fig:editingI-question3-plot-qdiff">6.11</a> we see that differences at the lower quantiles (<span class="math inline">\(Q_{0.05}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(Q_{0.35}\)</span>) are centred around negative values, reinforcing the fact that the shorter takes in Hitchcock’s sound films tend to be shorter than those in his silent films. At the same time, we see that the distributions of the differences between the upper quartiles lie to the right of 0s, again showing that the longer takes in the sound films tend be of greater duration than the silent films. As the distribution of differences shows two peaks for quantiles in the range <span class="math inline">\(Q_{0.55}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(Q_{0.85}\)</span> we can also identify the presence of sub-groups within the sample, which is accounted for by the second change in Hitchcock’s editing style with <em>Rich and Strange</em> and <em>Number Seventeen</em> and the shift of mass in the distributions to the lower tail that occurs with the use of rapidly edited montage and chase sequences.</p>

</h2>
<p>In this chapter we have covered a range of methods for thinking about shot length data distributionally. We have summarised and visualised the shot length data of films using quantile-based methods that are easy to implement and simple to understand.</p>
<p>We have also seen that the average shot length is not meaningful statistic of shot length data, containing no information about the distribution of shot lengths in a film. The ASL does not accurately reflect differences in the styles of motion pictures and does not accurately estimate differences in style. It does not answer the questions we wish to ask about film style.</p>
<p>If we want to ask the question ‘How do shot lengths in Hitchcock’s late-silent films compare to those of his early-sound films?’, then comparing the quantiles of the shot length distributions of these films shows that the difference in editing in these films is more complicated than can be conveyed by comparing their average shot lengths. The dominance statistics approach using <span class="math inline">\(HL\Delta\)</span> and Cliff’s <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> provides a more accurate global description of the differences in shot lengths of these films than the ASLs and the meaning and interpretation of these statistics correspond more closely to questions we wish to ask of shot length data. However, they do not automatically lead us to consider the nature of those differences. A key advantage of the quantile approach is that we can use this simple method tp identify and to talk about the complicated nature of these differences by thinking about shot lengths <em>distributionally</em>.</p>
